              You have reached the page for Terry Brown of Portland, Oregon. I
              am a 45 year old father, son, brother and partner. A current
              resident of Portland, Oregon, working on my 16th year with Union
              Pacific railroad. Things that bring me joy and make my world
              better are my kids, partner, music working out and traveling.
              <br />
              <br />
              My journey began in a small town in Northeast Louisiana, Monroe.
              At the age of 3 my family moved to the South side of Chicago, IL
              to Chicago Heights. Roughly 8 years later we relocated to Sandy,
              Utah on the South end of Salt Lake County. I would call SLC home
              for the next 18 years, as I completed my education at the
              Univerity of Utah in 2004 with two bachelors degrees in Psychology
              and Communications. I have always said I learn how to survive on
              the South side of Chicago and graduated with tools to thrive in
              SLC. I wouldn't be who I am today withouth both.
              <br />
              <br />
              After graduation I moved to Portland,Oregon to start working for
              Union Pacific railroad as an operating management trainee and have
              been on the move since then. In the past 16 years I moved from
              Portland to Eugene, Pocatello, St Louis, Omaha, SLC and back to
              Portland. I worked my way from trainee to General Superintendent
              and currently the Gen Manager of the PTRC. In my current position
              I felt it was the right time to develop new skills for the future.
              I know this course will be challenging and am looking forward to
              being able to apply lessons learned in the real world.
